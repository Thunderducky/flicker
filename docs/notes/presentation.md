Highlight given text
Give the user the ability to go back if they want

Picking good text

Have a way of looking at past actions

Always put the things you can do at the bottom of the screen?

I do like the ability to tooltip the information as well

It'd also be interesting to have an 'inventory' section so that the player is aware of what they have.

I also think it'd be neat to have it be broken into different sensory sections as well.

It'd be interesting to integrate this with a basic roguelike as well. Where you see where you are on a map and go to different places.
